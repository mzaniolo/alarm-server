# alarm-server

This is a prototype of an alarm server. This server is intended to read measurements from a RabbitMQ server and send alarms over a Websocket to a browser.

The prototype is been designed to only support a very simple alarm type where it will set the alarm if the meas is equal to the set value. The reset works the same way.

More features are planned. To see the backlog or to add suggestion of features take a look [here](https://github.com/users/mzaniolo/projects/1/views/3?sliceBy%5BcolumnId%5D=)
